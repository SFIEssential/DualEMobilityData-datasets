# DualEMobilityData-datasets
Welcome to our repository focused on E-Bike and E-Scooter trips. We aim to offer open-source datasets for E-Mobility research, particularly in urban commuting using electric bikes and scooters. These datasets, collected around Dublin City University, consider key factors influencing energy consumption.

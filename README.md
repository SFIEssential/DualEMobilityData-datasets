# DualEMobilityData-datasets
Welcome to our repository focused on E-Bike and E-Scooter trips. We aim to offer open-source datasets for E-Mobility research, particularly in urban commuting using electric bikes and scooters. These datasets, collected around Dublin City University, consider key factors influencing energy consumption.

# Dataset Description
Our datasets are divided into two parts: E-Bike and E-Scooter trips, totaling 36 and 30 trips, respectively. The E-Bike data were collected using the [Electric Trekking Bike T1](https://eleglide.com/products/removable-battery-100km-range-electric-trekking-touring-bike-t1) of Eleglide E-bike, and the E-Scooter data from the [Mi Electric Scooter Pro 2](https://www.xiaomi.ie/mi-electric-scooter-pro-2/) of Xiaomi E-Scooter. The process of data collection is presented in the picture below.

## E-Bike Dataset
The E-Bike featured in our dataset includes a 250 W motor with a top speed of 25 km/h, a range of 100 km, and a 450 Wh battery. It is equipped with a power assist module offering five levels of assist/electric mode corresponding to different speeds. Our dataset captures various real-world scenarios by including trip attributes for different pedal assist levels.

### Data Collection Setup
We employed the [iGS630 of iGPSPORT GPS Bike Computer](https://www.igpsport.com/igs630-highlights) and [LivLov V2 Bike Cadence and Speed Sensors](https://www.amazon.co.uk/LIVLOV-V2-Cadence-Speed-Sensor/dp/B08XNHDN6F?ref_=ast_sto_dp) for data collection. Attributes such as timestamps, GPS coordinates, altitude, speed, assistance level, and distance were recorded.

### Data Processing

- **Data Integration**: Merging data from devices for a unified dataset.
- **SOC Calculation**: Using a custom nonlinear equation for accurate SOC estimation.
- **Energy Efficiency Calculations**: Measuring energy consumption and efficiency.
- **Weather Data Incorporation**: Adding weather data from [Weather25](https://www.weather25.com/europe/ireland/leinster/dublin).
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating a synthetic dataset with Python's Synthetic Data Vault library.


## E-Scooter Dataset
Our E-Scooter dataset features the Mi Electric Scooter Pro 2, equipped with a 600-watt motor and a high-capacity 446 Wh lithium battery. The scooter offers three speed modes, and our data collection focused on the sports mode (0-25 km/h).

### Data Collection Setup
Two mobile applications were employed to gather attributes of E-Scooter trips, encompassing timestamp, GPS coordinates, altitude, speed, and SOC. The SOC was extracted from screen recordings using Xiaomiâ€™s official mobile application, [Mi Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaomi.smarthome&hl=en_US&pli=1), on an Android device (SAMSUNG Galaxy A53), while other attributes were directly acquired via a GPS tracking mobile application, [GPS-Tracker Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gps-tracker-pro/id984920064), on an Apple device (iPhone 11).

### Data Processing

- **Digit Extraction**: Using [pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) for SOC extraction.
- **Data Integration**: Integrating data from mobile applications using timestamps.
- **Weather Data Incorporation & Data Generation**: Employing methods similar to the E-Bike dataset.

## Sample Data Visualisation
A sample E-Scooter trip (Trip 27) is analysed and visualised in the pictures below.

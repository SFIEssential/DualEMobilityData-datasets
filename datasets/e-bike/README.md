Under the 'e-bike' directory lies the `data` directory containing all the collected data. This `data` directory is divided into two subdirectories: 

1. `data_with_real_timestamp`: This directory contains data with the original timestamp from when each trip was collected.
2. `data_with_relative_timestamp`: This directory holds data whose timestamps are calculated based on the time difference from the start of each trip.

Additionally, there is a `Index Table.csv` file under the 'e-bike' directory. This file is a summary of all the trip data collected and information about the data collector, including start/stop coordinates, start/stop voltage, total distance, total time, average gradient, descending SoC, calculated energy efficiency, and collector's height and weight information for each trip. There is also a `fake_bike_data.csv` file, which is generated by `sdv_bike_data_generator.ipynb`.

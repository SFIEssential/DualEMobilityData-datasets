Under the 'e-scooter' directory lies the `data` directory containing all the collected data. This `data` directory is divided into two subdirectories: 

1. `data_with_real_timestamp`: This directory contains data with the original timestamp from when each trip was collected.
2. `data_with_relative_timestamp`: This directory holds data whose timestamps are calculated based on the time difference from the start of each trip.

Additionally, there is a `data_summary.csv` file under the 'e-scooter' directory. This file provides a summary of each trip, including characteristics such as start time, weather, and altitude difference. There is also a `scooter_fake_data_new_file.csv` file, which is generated by `sdv_scooter_data_generator.ipynb`
